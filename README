# E-Shop (Demo)

> A small demo e-commerce web app used for the Web Development course (PUP‑SPC 3-1).

This repository contains a lightweight PHP/MySQL storefront used to demonstrate basic product listing, product details, and cart interactions. It uses Bootstrap for layout and simple client-side scripts for UI behaviors.

## Contributors

- Paulo Neil Sevilla
- Danzel Bordeos

## Features

- Product listing and featured products
- Product detail page with image, price, stock, and description
- Simple cart action (adds via a URL parameter)
- Bootstrap-based responsive UI

## Prerequisites

- PHP 7.4+ with mysqli extension
- MySQL / MariaDB / MySQL Server in XAMPP
- A web server or the built-in PHP server / XAMPP (Apache Server)
- (Optional) npm to install local copies of Bootstrap and jQuery used in the project

## Quick start

1. Import the database

	- Locate the SQL dump file (usually provided alongside this repository) and import it into your MySQL server.

2. Update database credentials

	- Open `misc/database.php` and edit the MySQL credentials (host, username, password, database) to match your environment.

3. (Optional) Install frontend deps

	- This project references local `node_modules` for Bootstrap and jQuery. To install them locally run:

```bash
npm install
```

	- If you prefer not to use npm, the app will still work if you swap those references to CDN links in the pages.

4. Run the app locally

```bash
# From the repository root
# Use PHP's built-in server on port 8088
php -S localhost:8088

# Then open http://localhost:8088 in your browser
```

### XAMPP users

If you prefer using XAMPP (Apache + MySQL), follow these steps instead of the PHP built-in server:

1. Copy the project folder into XAMPP's `htdocs` directory (for example: `C:\xampp\htdocs\e-shop` or `/opt/lampp/htdocs/e-shop`).
2. Start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP control panel or for Linux use the CLI method for XAMPP.
3. Import the SQL dump using phpMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin) or the `mysql` CLI into a database you create.
4. Update `misc/database.php` with your XAMPP MySQL credentials (default user is `root` and password is often empty on local XAMPP installs).
5. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost/e-shop` (replace `e-shop` with the folder name you used).


## Database notes

- After importing the SQL dump, update `misc/database.php` with your DB credentials.
- The code currently uses simple `mysqli` queries.

## Project structure (important files)

- `index.php` — Home / landing page
- `products.php` — Product listing page
- `product.php` — Product detail page (reads `id` from query string)
- `cart.php` — Simple cart actions
- `misc/database.php` — Database connection (update credentials here)
- `misc/rand_products.php` — Helpers for featured/random products
- `styles.css` — Project CSS (includes Bootstrap customizations)
